          <p>I worked with Paul for a number of years at Advanced where Paul worked as Principle Developer and Architect on our Payroll and Cash Flow Forecasting products.
            Paul is a natural communicator and problem solver, with a friendly, can do attitude. He has a great ability to learn new technologies whilst applying rigour through good development
            and architectural principles. A natural technical communicator that translates to an easy and friendly communication and leadership style.
            No challenge was too big and always executed with a smile, good humour and technical adeptness.
            An asset to any Engineering team!

          <p>I worked closely with Paul at Advanced Computer Software for over 7 years - I headed up the payroll product function and he was a key member of the payroll development team.
            Paul has very strong technical skills with a genuine aptitude to think out of the box. He grasps complex issues quickly offering suggested solutions in a timely manner.
            He is engaging, a fantastic mentor and always willing to give time to support his peers.
            Paul has since taken up the role of Technical Architect at Advanced, a role entirely suited to him providing access to new technologies and processes,
            and allowing influence over product direction.

          <p>Not only is Paul a very amiable fellow , he is quite simply one of the most talented developers I've had the pleasure of working with in my IT career.
            We worked together as developers in Aberdeen at Advanced. The majority of jobs at that time dealt mainly working with Progress/OpenEdge technologies on
            many in-house systems. Paul has that "can-do" attitude you'd wish in a developer, and an ability to rapidly learn IT technologies that are thrown at him.
            He excels in learning new systems. Coupled together with his understanding for business requirements and a belief in getting things done properly,
            I can't recommend Paul highly enough.

          I had the pleasure of working with Paul for near on three years at Advanced, collaborating on many high profile projects. I was particularly impressed by Paul's ability to understand new technology and able to research and find the solution to the problems we faced.
          Oh, and he made sure I got emailed about Friday lunchtime staff choices be it Chinese, Thai, chippy etc even though there was some 450+ miles between our office's. Talk about motivating a team!
          Paul would be an asset to any team.
