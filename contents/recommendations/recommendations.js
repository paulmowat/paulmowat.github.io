          <p>Talented Individualâ€™ is the phrase that comes to mind when I think about Paul.
          I had the pleasure of working with Paul for near on three years at Advanced, collaborating on many high profile projects. I was particularly impressed by Paul's ability to understand new technology and able to research and find the solution to the problems we faced.
          Oh, and he made sure I got emailed about Friday lunchtime staff choices be it Chinese, Thai, chippy etc even though there was some 450+ miles between our office's. Talk about motivating a team!
          Paul would be an asset to any team.
