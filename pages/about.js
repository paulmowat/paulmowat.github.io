                Based near Aberdeen Scotland, I currently work for <Link href='https://www.oneadvanced.com'>OneAdvanced</Link> as an Principal DevOps Architect.
              </p>
              <p>
                I have 18+ years experience designing, implementing, and supporting large-scale applications across multiple platforms and technologies.
              </p>
              <p>
                I specialise in DevOps, CI/CD, and Cloud Migration architecture, with a focus on standardisation and accelerating delivery on platforms like AWS, Azure, and Harness.
              </p>
              <p>
                I engage with stakeholders at all levels and external partners to ensure projects are designed and delivered according to best practices, whilst remaining aligned to business goals.
              </p>
              <p>
                I have experience in all areas of the SDLC, from design, and development, to infrastructure as code (IaC) and operation. My experience also extends to development using Node.js, Progress OpenEdge, C#, SQL Server, Java, HTML, CSS and Javascript.
              </p>
              <p>
                I am a strong advocate for best practices, security and cost optimization in cloud environments.
              </p>
              <p>
                I enjoy working within a team and have experience leading teams of developers using traditional and agile methodologies to meet tight deadlines.
              </p>
              <p>
                During my spare time, I also seek to continually improve my skills and knowledge and as such I enjoy learning about new emerging technologies.
              </p>
              <p>
                My other interests include photography, watching movies and spending time with my wife and son.
